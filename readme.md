node-basic is a BASIC parser and executor written in Javascript. It can be used in Node or compiled with Browserify for use in a browser.

node-basic uses the flavor of BASIC from the iBASIC iOS app, however is designed to be flexible and easily modifiable.

node-basic should be able to run any programs written for iBASIC. While it is currently incomplete, the majority of programs should run fine, considering they are provided with a graphical environment supporting all commands.

node-basic includes a flexible interface to allow for the parent application to receive all terminal IO and rendering commands. An 'offical' web-based IDE is currently in the works.
